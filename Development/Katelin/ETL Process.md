# ETL Process

The COVID-19 pandemic as changed how people arouond the world live their daily lives. One major area of change is education. In this project we were interested in learning more about the content of online learning platforms. We gathered data from two of the most popular MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), EdX and Coursera. We also used data from YouTube use from 10 countries/regions. 

## Step 1 - Extract

#### Data Sources: 
* Harvard and MIT courses offered by EdX (one .csv from Kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/edx/course-study
* Coursea course descriptions (one .csv from Kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/mihirs16/coursera-course-data
* List of MOOCs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MOOC_providers
* Attributes of Common MOOCs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course
* YouTube Video Statistics for 10 Countries (.csv from Kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new
* YouTube Video Category IDs for 10 Countries (.json from Kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new

1. Read the .csv files with Pandas read_csv()
2. Read the .json files with Pandas read_json()
3. Extract the Wikipedia tables using Pandas read_html()

## Step 2 - Transform

#### Use the data to create the following tables:
* EdX Courses Offered (FKs: MOOC, Master Category)
* Coursera Courses Offered (FKs: MOOC, Master Category)
* List of MOOCs (FK: MOOC)
* MOOC Attributes (FK: MOOC)
* YouTube Video Categories (PK & FK: CategoryID)
* YouTube Countries (PK & FK: CountryCode)
* YouTube Video Data (FKs: CategoryID & CountryCode)
* Master Category Table for YouTube and MOOCs (PK & FK: Master Category)

## Step 3 - Load

1. Create database structure: quickdatabasediagrams.com
2. Create the "online_ed_db" using PostgreSQL
3. Use the table structures extracted from quickdatabasediagrams.com to define the structure of the database
